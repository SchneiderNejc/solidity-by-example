# Errors

Best Practices for Throwing Errors in Solidity
Use require:

For input validation and conditions that depend on user behavior (e.g., require(msg.value >= price)).
Add clear and concise error messages for better debugging.
Use revert:

For complex conditions or when a fallback/early exit is required with a detailed error message.
Use assert:

Only for internal invariants that should never fail if the contract logic is correct.
Avoid using assert for user input validation.
Use Custom Errors:

For gas-efficient error handling, especially in frequently called functions.
To pass structured data along with errors, enabling better debugging and integration.
