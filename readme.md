# Errors

Best Practices for Throwing Errors in Solidity
Use require:

For input validation and conditions that depend on user behavior (e.g., require(msg.value >= price)).
Add clear and concise error messages for better debugging.
Use revert:

For complex conditions or when a fallback/early exit is required with a detailed error message.
Use assert:

Only for internal invariants that should never fail if the contract logic is correct.
Avoid using assert for user input validation.
Use Custom Errors:

For gas-efficient error handling, especially in frequently called functions.
To pass structured data along with errors, enabling better debugging and integration.

# Events

Best Practices and Recommendations
Index the right event parameters to enable efficient filtering and searching. Addresses should typically be indexed, while amounts generally should not.
Avoid redundant events by not emitting events that are already covered by underlying libraries or contracts.
Events cannot be used in view or pure functions, as they alter the state of the blockchain by storing logs.
Be mindful of the gas cost associated with emitting events, especially when indexing parameters, as it can impact the overall gas consumption of your contract.
